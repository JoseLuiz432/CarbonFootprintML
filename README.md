# CarbonFootprintML

## Description

The CarbonFootprintML project aims to explore a dataset related to carbon footprint and develop a machine learning regression model to predict carbon footprints based on various factors. This project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, evaluation, and interpretation. The dataset used in this project can be found at [Kragle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dumanmesut/individual-carbon-footprint-calculation).
